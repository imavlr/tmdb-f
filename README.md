# TMDb CC frontend

This was made for a technical test, this is not a real or production ready project.
Heavy refactoring would be needed before this should be looked at for inspiration.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Install the Dependencies

First, you need to create your environment file. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

If you do not wish to install deno (deno is a single executable), you can grab a "portable" executable from [the official deno repo](https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases)

```bash
deno install
```

### 2. You Should Now Be Ready to Go

Run the application in dev mode with:

```bash
deno task dev
```

The web application should now be available on `http://localhost:5173`.
